# Runner Game

Game is about running into snails and flies that focus on how to implement Sprite classes and learning Pygame fundamentals that pair with OOP. I followed a video made by [[@clear-code-projects(https://github.com/clear-code-projects)](https://github.com/clear-code-projects) and would like to thank him for the tutorial! Check out his full video on his YouTube to learn more about this project.

## Running the game

1. Fork this repository.

2. Install pygame and make sure you have Python 3.11.1

3. Run the command 'py main.py' and press space to play!


## Personal Improvements

- Added a speed up to make the game more interesting and to add more difficulty. There is a flash effect so be wary of that when your score hits 30. 

- Added a death sound.

## Future additions/improvements to be made

- Adding a scoreboard, saving your score and trying to beat mine


Don't forget to share, have fun and enjoy the games!
